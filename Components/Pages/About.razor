        <p>👋 Hi there! I’m <strong>Eadyn</strong>, a computer science student and aspiring data scientist with a
            passion for turning complex datasets into actionable insights. I’m particularly interested in how AI and
            machine learning can transform healthcare and make a real impact on people’s lives.</p>

        <p>With a strong foundation in Python and SQL, and hands-on experience in data analysis and image processing, I
            enjoy solving real-world problems with a mix of creativity and precision. My recent projects can be found in
            the 'Projects' tab.</p>

        <p>📈 <strong>Career Goals</strong>: I aim to join a dynamic team where I can leverage my analytical skills to
            contribute to impactful projects, especially those involving health analytics, precision medicine, or
            data-driven decision-making.</p>

        <p>Outside of tech, I’m always up for a hike or a good sci-fi novel (my favorite is <i>Dune</i>). Let’s
            connect—I’m always excited to collaborate on meaningful projects or chat about the future of data in
            healthcare.</p>
